## Description üìù
The **my_paint** is a project carried out by **groups of 2** (see [Contributors](https://github.com/toro-nicolas/my_paint/blob/main/README.md#contributors-), during our **1st year** in [**EPITECH**](https://www.epitech.eu/) Grand Ecole program.  
Its purpose is to create in [**C**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) a **drawing software**, inspired by [**Microsoft Paint**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Paint).  
The aim of the project is to create a **software interface** for **drawing** and **creating images**.


## Usage ‚öîÔ∏è
You can run my_paint like this :
```sh
./my_paint
```

For more information, please see the help section or the tutorial.
```sh

### Tests and code coverage
**Unit tests** were performed using [criterion](https://criterion.readthedocs.io/en/master/intro.html).  
In this project, **only** the **library code is covered**.  
Unit tests are still to be performed, but a large part of the code is already covered.  

You can compile the project and run the unit tests with this command :
```sh
make tests_run
```


## Compilation üõ†Ô∏è
You can compile the project with this command :
```sh
make
```

If you want clean the project, you can run this command :
```sh
make fclean
```

You can clean and compile the project with ```make re```.    

You can compile the unit tests with this command :
```sh
make unit_tests
```


## Code mandatory üì¶
- You'll need to create a branch where you'll push your code. Once you've completed your tasks on this branch, we'll work together to merge it and check that everything works.
- Every function you add must be code-style.
- Before merging, you'll need to check that all unit tests pass by running ```make tests_run```.
- Each commit will contain ```[+]``` or ```[-]``` or ```[~]``` followed by a message
    - ```[+]``` : Add feature
    - ```[-]``` : Delete feature
    - ```[~]``` : Edit feature

**Of course, in exceptional cases, we may depart from these rules.**


## What's next ? üöÄ
- Finish the selection tool
- Add the copy/paste tool
- Add documentation on each functions
- Add unit tests on each piece of code
